### Technical Requirements for WordPress Resume and Job Application Plugin

#### 1. System Overview
The plugin, named **ResumeAIJobPlugin**, extends WordPress to provide a resume management and job application system. It includes user registration, resume upload, AI-powered resume enhancement, version selection, resume posting, and a job posting/application system. The plugin integrates with WordPress’s user system, REST API, and leverages an external AI service for resume analysis.

#### 2. Functional Requirements

##### 2.1 User Signup and Resume Upload
- **User Registration**:
  - Utilize WordPress’s native user registration system (`wp_users` and `wp_usermeta` tables).
  - Add a custom registration form with fields: First Name, Last Name, Email, Password, and optional fields (e.g., LinkedIn URL).
  - Assign users a custom role (`resume_user`) with permissions to upload and manage resumes.
  - Implement reCAPTCHA or similar to prevent spam registrations.
- **Resume Upload**:
  - Provide a front-end form in the user dashboard (shortcode `[resume_upload_form]`) for uploading resumes.
  - Support file formats: PDF, DOCX (max size: 5MB).
  - Store resumes in the WordPress media library with metadata linking to the user (`user_id`).
  - Validate file type and size before upload.

##### 2.2 AI Resume Analysis and Improvement
- **AI Integration**:
  - Integrate with an external AI service (e.g., xAI’s API or a third-party NLP service like OpenAI) via REST API for resume analysis.
  - Extract text from uploaded resumes using a library like `pdf2text` (PHP) or `python-docx` (via a Python microservice).
  - Send extracted text to the AI service with prompts to:
    - Analyze resume for clarity, keywords, and ATS (Applicant Tracking System) compatibility.
    - Generate two improved versions:
      - Version 1: ATS-optimized (keyword-rich, structured).
      - Version 2: Human-readable (narrative, polished formatting).
  - Store AI-generated versions as new files (PDF) in the media library, linked to the original resume via custom post meta.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Handle API failures gracefully with user-friendly error messages (e.g., “AI service temporarily unavailable”).
  - Cache AI responses for 24 hours to reduce API calls for repeated analysis.

##### 2.3 Resume Version Selection and Posting
- **Version Selection**:
  - Display a front-end interface (shortcode `[resume_dashboard]`) showing the original resume and two AI-generated versions.
  - Allow users to preview resumes (embed PDF viewer or download links).
  - Enable users to select one version (original or AI-generated) via a radio button or dropdown.
- **Posting to Resume System**:
  - Create a custom post type (`resume_post`) to store posted resumes.
  - Fields: Title, User ID, Resume File (media library ID), Status (Draft, Published), Timestamp.
  - Allow users to post the selected resume to the system, marking it as “Published.”
  - Provide an option to edit or replace the posted resume, updating the `resume_post` entry.

##### 2.4 Job Posting and Application Component
- **Job Posting (Admin)**:
  - Create a custom post type (`job_post`) for job listings.
  - Fields: Job Title, Description, Location, Salary Range, Application Deadline, Status (Open, Closed).
  - Restrict creation/editing to users with `administrator` or custom `job_manager` role.
  - Provide a back-end interface in the WordPress admin panel and a front-end form (shortcode `[job_post_form]`) for admins.
- **Job Application (User)**:
  - Display job listings on a front-end page (shortcode `[job_listings]`) with filters (e.g., location, keyword).
  - Allow users to apply by selecting a posted resume (`resume_post`) and submitting a cover letter (optional).
  - Store applications in a custom table (`wp_resume_applications`):
    - Columns: `application_id`, `user_id`, `job_id`, `resume_id`, `cover_letter`, `status` (Pending, Reviewed, Accepted, Rejected), `timestamp`.
  - Notify admins via email (using `wp_mail()`) when applications are submitted.
  - Allow admins to update application status and notify applicants via email.

##### 2.5 Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**:
  - Optimize database queries using WordPress transients for caching job listings and resume previews.
  - Compress uploaded resumes to reduce storage usage.
- **Security**:
  - Sanitize and validate all user inputs (e.g., file uploads, form submissions).
  - Restrict resume access to the owning user and admins (using `current_user_can()`).
  - Use WordPress nonces for form submissions to prevent CSRF attacks.
  - Encrypt sensitive API keys (AI service) in the WordPress options table using `wp_encrypt_data()`.
- **Scalability**:
  - Support up to 10,000 users and 1,000 job postings with efficient database indexing.
  - Use asynchronous processing (e.g., WP Background Processing) for AI analysis to prevent timeouts.
- **Usability**:
  - Provide a responsive, mobile-friendly front-end using Tailwind CSS (via CDN).
  - Ensure compatibility with major WordPress themes (e.g., Astra, OceanWP).
- **Compatibility**:
  - Compatible with WordPress 6.0+ and PHP 7.4+.
  - Test with popular plugins (e.g., Yoast SEO, WooCommerce) to avoid conflicts.

#### 3. Technical Architecture

├── languages/
│   ├── resume-ai-job-plugin.pot     # Translation file


##### 3.2 Database Schema
Leverage WordPress’s database with custom tables and post types:
- **Custom Post Types**:
  - `resume_post`: Stores posted resumes (CPT).
  - `job_post`: Stores job listings (CPT).
- **Custom Table**:
  - `wp_resume_applications`:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE wp_resume_applications (
        application_id BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
        user_id BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
        job_id BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
        resume_id BIGINT(20) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
        cover_letter TEXT,
        status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'Pending',
        created_at DATETIME NOT NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY (application_id),
        FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES wp_users(ID),
        FOREIGN KEY (job_id) REFERENCES wp_posts(ID),
        FOREIGN KEY (resume_id) REFERENCES wp_posts(ID)
    );
    ```
- **Post Meta**:
  - For `resume_post`: `original_resume_id`, `ai_version_1_id`, `ai_version_2_id`, `selected_version_id`.
  - For `job_post`: `location`, `salary_range`, `deadline`.

##### 3.3 API Integration
- **AI Service**:
  - Use REST API (e.g., xAI’s API at `https://x.ai/api`) with POST requests to analyze resumes.
  - Example request:
    ```json
    {
      "text": "Resume content here",
      "prompt": "Generate two improved versions: ATS-optimized and human-readable"
    }
    ```
  - Store API key in WordPress options (`wp_options`) and secure it.
- **WordPress REST API**:
  - Register custom endpoints for resume upload, version selection, job applications:
    - `POST /wp-json/resumeai/v1/upload`: Upload resume.
    - `GET /wp-json/resumeai/v1/resumes/{user_id}`: Retrieve user’s resumes.
    - `POST /wp-json/resumeai/v1/apply`: Submit job application.

##### 3.4 Front-End
- **Shortcodes**:
  - `[resume_upload_form]`: Resume upload form.
  - `[resume_dashboard]`: Resume version selection and posting.
  - `[job_post_form]`: Job posting form (admin-only).
  - `[job_listings]`: Job listings with apply button.
- **Styling**:
  - Use Tailwind CSS via CDN for responsive design.
  - Example form styling:
    ```html
    <form class="max-w-lg mx-auto p-4 bg-white shadow-md rounded">
      <input type="file" class="w-full p-2 mb-4 border rounded" accept=".pdf,.docx">
      <button type="submit" class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-2 rounded hover:bg-blue-600">Upload</button>
    </form>
    ```
- **JavaScript**:
  - Use jQuery (bundled with WordPress) for AJAX form submissions.
  - Validate file uploads client-side (size, type).

##### 3.5 Back-End
- **PHP Classes**:
  - Modular classes in `includes/` for each feature (e.g., `ResumeAIJobPlugin_User_Management`).
  - Use WordPress hooks (`init`, `wp_enqueue_scripts`, `rest_api_init`) for initialization.
- **Cron Jobs**:
  - Schedule cleanup of unposted resumes older than 30 days using `wp_cron`.
- **Logging**:
  - Log AI API errors and application submissions in a custom table (`wp_resume_logs`) for debugging.

#### 4. Development Tools
- **Languages**: PHP 7.4+, JavaScript (ES6), HTML5, CSS3.
- **Libraries**:
  - Tailwind CSS (CDN).
  - PDF parsing: `smalot/pdfparser` (PHP).
  - DOCX parsing: `phpword` or Python microservice.
- **Dev Environment**:
  - Local WordPress setup (LocalWP or Docker).
  - VS Code with PHP Intelephense and WordPress coding standards.
- **Testing**:
  - Unit tests with PHPUnit for PHP logic.
  - E2E tests with Cypress for front-end forms.
  - Test AI integration with mock API responses.

#### 5. Deployment
- **Packaging**:
  - Bundle plugin as a `.zip` file for WordPress plugin repository or manual installation.
- **Installation**:
  - Install via WordPress admin (`Plugins > Add New`).
  - Activate and configure settings (API key, file size limits) via a settings page (`Settings > ResumeAIJobPlugin`).
- **Updates**:
  - Use WordPress update API for versioned updates.
  - Maintain changelog and backward compatibility.

#### 6. Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: AI API downtime.
  - **Mitigation**: Cache AI responses and fall back to original resume if API fails.
- **Risk**: Large file uploads causing timeouts.
  - **Mitigation**: Enforce 5MB limit and use chunked uploads if needed.
- **Risk**: Security vulnerabilities in file uploads.
  - **Mitigation**: Validate file types, scan uploads with WordPress’s file security functions, and restrict access.
- **Risk**: WordPress theme/plugin conflicts.
  - **Mitigation**: Test with popular themes/plugins and use namespaced functions/classes.
